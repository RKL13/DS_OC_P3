# Conceptualize an application and provide an actionable data set for public health based on Openfoodfacts's data

### Mission

This project is a Data Analysis one. Starting from OpenFoodFacts data, we had to imagine an application for public health. 

Long story short, the application would allow users to scan a basket's products and communicate the total basket's healthiness. 
As we wanted to put the user in a virtuous circle, we shifted the application from communicating on a basket value without referential. Instead, we considered a ratio of improvement computed in between two baskets from the same user a t one and t-1 one. In doing so, we considered that we could "nudge" the habits of a user by promoting little changes in the long run rather than drastic changes that won't last. 

We were asked to prepare data for the development team to implement the conceptualized app. 

This was the occasion to strengthen our data cleaning skills (among others, using several imputation techniques, several approaches to detect outliers, etc.) and improve our data visualization skills using dimensionality reduction (PCA).
